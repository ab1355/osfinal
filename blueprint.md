- **Task Queue:** Displays the current queue of tasks.
- **Quick Actions:** Allows for the quick creation of new tasks.
- **Task History:** Displays a history of completed tasks.
- **`bytebot-research.ts` script:** A script for automating research tasks.

### C-Suite Coordination Flow

- **`CSuiteStatus` component:** A component for monitoring the status of C-Suite agents.

### Resource Optimization

- **`ResourceMonitor` component:** A component for monitoring resource usage.
- **Mock `scaleUp` and `scaleDown` functions:** Functions for optimizing resource usage.

### Automated Deployment

- **`AkashDeployment` component:** A component for deploying the application to the Akash Network.
- **Mock `deployToAkash` function:** A function for deploying the application to the Akash Network.

### Research Impact Analysis

- **`ResearchImpact` component:** A component for analyzing the impact of research findings.
- **Mock `analyzeResearch` function:** A function for analyzing the impact of research findings.

### Roadmap Auto-Update

- **`RoadmapTimeline` component:** A component for displaying the project roadmap.
- **Mock `updateRoadmap` function:** A function for automatically updating the project roadmap.

### Style and Design

- **Dark Mode:** The application uses a dark theme.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** A sidebar for navigating between pages.
- **Modern Design:** The application uses modern design principles, including a clean layout and modern components.

## Current Plan

- All tasks are complete.

## Summary of Work Done

In this session, I implemented the following features:

- **C-Suite Coordination Flow:** I created a `CSuiteStatus` component to monitor the status of C-Suite agents.
- **Resource Optimization:** I created a `ResourceMonitor` component and mock `scaleUp` and `scaleDown` functions to simulate resource optimization.
- **Automated Deployment:** I created an `AkashDeployment` component and a mock `deployToAkash` function to simulate deployment to the Akash Network.
- **Research Impact Analysis:** I created a `ResearchImpact` component and a mock `analyzeResearch` function to simulate the analysis of research findings.
- **Roadmap Auto-Update:** I created a `RoadmapTimeline` component and a mock `updateRoadmap` function to simulate the automatic updating of the project roadmap.

I also updated the sidebar navigation to include a link to the new `/optimization` page. Finally, I updated this `blueprint.md` file to reflect all the changes I've made.
