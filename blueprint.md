# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a C-Suite Operations Dashboard, a comprehensive interface for managing and automating key business functions. It provides a centralized platform for:

*   **Roadmap Visualization:** A dynamic and interactive roadmap to track strategic initiatives.
*   **Research Automation:** AI-powered research capabilities to gather and analyze information.
*   **Agent Management:** A system for managing and coordinating a team of AI agents.
*   **Cloud Deployment:** A streamlined interface for deploying applications to the Akash Network.

## Design and Features

The application is built with a modern, glassmorphism-inspired design, creating a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. Key design elements include:

*   **Glassmorphism:** A frosted-glass effect is used for backgrounds and UI elements, creating a sense of depth and transparency.
*   **Vibrant Colors:** A palette of vibrant colors is used to create a visually energetic and engaging interface.
*   **Modern Typography:** Expressive and relevant typography is used to enhance readability and visual hierarchy.
*   **Interactive Iconography:** Icons are used to enhance understanding and navigation.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and web.

### Key Features:

*   **Dashboard:** The main dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the application's key functions.
*   **Research Page:** This page allows users to generate research queries and view a feed of AI-powered research results.
*   **Agents Page:** This page provides a system for managing and coordinating a team of AI agents.
*   **Deployment Page:** This page allows users to deploy applications to the Akash Network.

## Current Change: QuestFlow Backend Integration

The focus of this session was to transition the frontend application from using mocked, static data to a fully integrated system connected to the live 371 OS QuestFlow backend.

### Integration Steps

1.  **Environment Configuration:** A `.env.local` file was created to store the QuestFlow API and WebSocket URLs.
2.  **`QuestFlowBridge` Implementation:** The `src/lib/questflow-bridge.ts` file was rewritten to make live API calls to the QuestFlow backend for all methods. This involved:
    *   Using `fetch` to make `GET` and `POST` requests.
    *   Implementing robust error handling for all API requests.
    *   Using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_QUESTFLOW_API_URL` environment variable.
3.  **Type Definitions:** A new `src/types/questflow.ts` file was created to house all QuestFlow-related type definitions, including new types for `CSuiteStatus`, `TechStackPayload`, `ScalePayload`, and `OptimizePayload`.
4.  **`RealtimeSync` Implementation:** The `src/lib/realtime.ts` file was rewritten to establish a real-time WebSocket connection to the QuestFlow server. This involved:
    *   Using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_QUESTFLOW_WS_URL` environment variable.
    *   Implementing event handlers (`onopen`, `onmessage`, `onclose`, `onerror`).
    *   Adding a reconnection mechanism.
    *   Broadcasting incoming messages using custom events.
5.  **Verification and Cleanup:** The page components (`dashboard`, `research`, and `automation`) were reviewed to ensure they were using the live data from the `QuestFlowBridge` and `RealtimeSync` classes. Mock data and placeholder code were removed.

### Outcome

The frontend application is now fully integrated with the 371 OS QuestFlow backend. All data is now fetched from and sent to the live backend, and real-time updates are received via a WebSocket connection. The application is now in a fully operational state.
